# Ariel Data Challenge

Python 3.9.6 and CUDA 11.3.1.

## TODO list

1. Add dropout and use "model.eval()" during testing.
1. Use annotations from forward model?
1. Unsupervised pre-training (see Erhan et al., 2010)?
1. Out-of-distribution trainset and validset split?
1. Choose loss function: KL divergence, NLL, or CRPS?
1. Optimise deep ensemble.
1. Scale targets?
1. "torch.nn.GaussianNLLLoss" can be used.
