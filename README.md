# Ariel Data Challenge

Python 3.9.6 and CUDA 11.3.1.

## TODO list

1. Out-of-distribution trainset and validset split?
1. Implement full covariance matrix?
1. Choose loss function: KL divergence, NLL, or CRPS?
1. Optimise deep ensemble.
1. Early stopping on a correct metric: is light score the metric? Maybe KL divergence?
1. Remove early stopping?
1. Use annotations from forward model?
1. Scale targets?
