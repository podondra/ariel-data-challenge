# Ariel Data Challenge

Python 3.9.6 and CUDA 11.3.1.

## TODO list

1. Implement full covariance matrix?
1. Optimize hyperparameters of the convolutional neural network.
1. Early stopping on a correct metric: is light score the metric?
1. Noisy spectra, maybe as data augmentation.
1. Add regularisation, e.g. dropout.
1. Use annotations from forward model?
1. Data preparation according to F. Ardévol Martínez et al. (2022)?
