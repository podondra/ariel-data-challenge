# Ariel Data Challenge

Python 3.9.6 and CUDA 11.3.1.

## TODO list

1. Implement full covariance matrix?
1. Choose loss function: KL divergence, NLL, or CRPS?
1. Early stopping on a correct metric: is light score the metric? Maybe KL divergence?
1. Use annotations from forward model?
1. Data preparation according to F. Ardévol Martínez et al. (2022)?
1. Out-of-distribution train and validation set split?
